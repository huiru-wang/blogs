description: 链上coin和token的区别
---

# Coin

A Coin is a digital currency. It operates on its own blockchain with its own protocol.
Coins are purely used as a source of payments.
Coin can be called `Native Token`；

# Token
A Token is a digital asset issued on a particular project.
Token does not operate on their own blockchain.
Tokens are used for payments and signing digital agreements.

简单理解：
Coin是一个区块链网络内的唯一货币；任何需要支付的gas都必须使用coin；也叫Native Token；
Token是有智能合约平台的区块链上构建的第三方产品，可以构建无数个。具体Token的用途、规范由合约决定。
